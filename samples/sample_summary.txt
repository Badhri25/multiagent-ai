This research paper explores the rapid evolution and scalability of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and PaLM. 
It discusses their architectural backbone—transformers, attention mechanisms, and massive datasets—and how these models are pre-trained and fine-tuned for downstream NLP tasks. 
The paper also covers challenges like hallucinations, prompt engineering, bias, and computational cost. Overall, it emphasizes the potential and limitations of LLMs in real-world applications.
